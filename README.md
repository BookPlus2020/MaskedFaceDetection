# MaskedFaceDetection
I have one paper named "Masked Face Detection Using A Two-stage Classification Approach" that has been submitted to ICASSP2021.
Here, I present the dataset used in my paper. 

The training data can be accessed by "https://pan.baidu.com/s/1GPB2apHqwEHAv3JP-clnQA"， extract code：5rvb.  

It also includes the trained models. The source code will be open later.
